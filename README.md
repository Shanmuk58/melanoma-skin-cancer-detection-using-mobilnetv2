🧬 Melanoma Cancer Detection using Deep Learning
This project focuses on the early detection of melanoma — a serious form of skin cancer — using deep learning techniques. By training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on dermatoscopic images, this model aims to assist in the accurate and efficient classification of potentially cancerous skin lesions.
